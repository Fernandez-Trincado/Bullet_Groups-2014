\begin{abstract}

We estimate the expected distribution of displacements between the two
dominant dark matter density peaks and between baryons and dark matter
in halos simulated within a full cosmological context. We use as a benchmark the
observation of \bullg, which is the lowest mass system observed so far
featuring a bi-modal dark matter distribution with a dislocated 
baryonic component. We extend previous results by
studying two halo samples: groups and clusters. We find that 50\% to 60\%
of the dark matter halos with circular velocities in the range
$300\kms$ to $700\kms$ (groups) show multimodal morphologies with
displacements between the dark matter clumps equal or larger than
$133\pm21$\hkpc as observed in \bullg. For dark matter halos with
circular velocities larger than $700\kms$ (clusters) this fraction
rises to $80\%$ to $85\%$. Using the same simulation we estimate the
dark matter-to-baryon spatial separation and find that $0.1\%$ to
$1.0\%$ of the groups should present separations equal or
larger than $87\pm 14$\hkpc corresponding to our observational
benchmark; for clusters this fraction is in the range of $4\%$ to
$10\%$, consistent with previous studies of dark matter to baryon
separations. The extension of the theoretical predictions and
observational results towards low mass Bullet-like configurations,
i.e. larger abundance of systems,  opens up the possibility for a new
statistical test of  $\Lambda$CDM.

\section{Introduction}


The Bullet Cluster (massive cluster of galaxies \bulla) provided a new
kind of observational evidence for the existence of dark matter
\citep{Markevitch2004,Clowe2006}. Quantifying the displacement between
dark matter and the dominant baryonic component (hot X-ray emitting gas)
has been used to test the Cold Dark Matter (CDM)
paradigm itself by quantifying the substructure velocity required to
produce such displacement \citep{Hayashi2006, Springel2007,
  Thompson2012}, the displacemeent between the dominant dark matter
and baryonic component \citep{ForeroRomero2010} to estimate the
expected abundance of such events in a $\Lambda$CDM Universe and even
explore possible extensions to the concordance cosmological model
\citep{Farrar2007,Lee2010,Lee2012}.    


Since then, other examples of Bullet-like systems have been found; 
MACS J0025.4-1222 \citep{Bradac2008}, Abell 2744 \citep{Merten2011},
DLSCL J0916.2+2951 \citep{Dawson2012}, ZwCl 1234.0+02916
\citep{Dahle2013}. Recently \citep{Gastaldello} observed baryonic-DM
displacement if $124\pm 20$ kpc in a group-like system with a total
mass $2.4\pm 0.6 \times 10^{14}$\Msun. Systems of this mass are
$\sim10$ times more abundant than cluster systems in the mass range of
the Bullet Cluster $>10^{15}$\hMsun, this opens up the possibility of
observationally finding bullet groups in a fair amount to impose
constraints on $\Lambda$CDM. 


However, a greater abundance of small mass systems has to be weighted
by the probability of having a merger and 
presenting a large displacement between the DM and baryonic
components. These two conditions (merger rates, maximum possible
displacement) are a funcion of halo mass in $\Lambda$CDM
cosmologies.  Such study has been performed for clusters but not for
lower mass systems \citep{ForeroRomero2010}. The existence of objects
like \bullg and observational campaigns like the Strong Lensing Legacy
Survey (SL2S) open up the possibility of finding multi-modal dark
matter distributions in the group mass range.


In this Letter we compute the abundance of group-like dark
matter halos with a multi-modal morphology that also might present a
DM-baryon displacement. To this end we use a N-body cosmological
simulation with such a resolution that allows us to identify
multi-modal dark matter distributions in hosts with circular velocities
larger than $300$\kms.  

This Letter is organized as the follows. In Section
\ref{sec:simulation} we present the simulation and the halo catalogs
used in this work. We continue in Section \ref{sec:setup} with the
geometry of the problem at hand and the measurements setup. Next in
Section \ref{sec:results} we present our results and observational
perspectives to finally conclude in Sections \ref{sec:conclusions}. 


\section{Simulation, halo catalogs and pairs}
\label{sec:simulation}

We use the Bolshoi Run, a cosmological DM only simulation over a cubic
volume of 250\hMpc comoving on a side. The simulation uses the ART code to
follow the evolution of a dark matter density field sampled with
$2048^3$ from $z=80$ to $z=0$. The cosmology used  corresponds
to  the spatially flat concordance model with the following
parameters:  the density parameter for matter (dark matter and baryons)
$\Omega_m=0.27$, the density parameter for baryonic matter
$\Omega_b=0.0469$, the density parameter for dark energy
$\Omega_{\Lambda}=0.73$, the Hubble parameter $h=0.7$, the
normalization of the Power spectrum $n=0.95$ and the amplitude of mass
density fluctuation (at redshift z$=$0) $\sigma_8=0.82$.  These
cosmological parameters are consistent with the nine-year Wilikinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) results \citep{hinshaw_etal13}. A
detailed presentation of the simulation can be found in
\citet{2011ApJ...740..102K}.     


The number of particles used for each of the DM component was
$2048^3$, resulting in a mass resolution of $1.35 \times 10^8$
M$_{\odot}$h$^{-1}$. The completeness limit in this simulation is set
for halos with $100$ particles corresponding to a mass of
$1.35\times10^{10}$\hMsun or a maximum circular velocity $V_{c}$ of
$50$\kms. 

We use halo catalogs constructed using the Bound Density Maxima (BDM)
algorithm \citep{BDM,BDMb}. To define the radius of a halo we use a
density threshold of 360 times the mean density of the Universe, for 
different redshifts we use the overdensity criterion by
\cite{Bryan1998}. An important feature of BDM is that it allows us to
detect sub-halos inside larger virialized structures. 


All the raw data used in this Letter is
available through the Multidark database \footnote{\texttt{www.multidark.org}}
\citep{Riebe2013}.  Furthermore, in order to facilitate the
reproducibility and reuse of our results we have made available all
the data and the source code available in a public
repository \footnote{\texttt{https://github.com/Fernandez-Trincado/Bullet\_Groups-2014}}.

In this Letter we make a study at four different redhifts $z=0.0,0.25,
0.5$ and $1.0$. First, we select all the host halos (i.e. halos that
are not inside a larger halo) with circular velocities $V_{\rm c}\geq
300$\kms. Then, we select the sub-halos with circular velocities
$V_{\rm c}\geq 75$\kms. The objective is to use this sub-halos as the
tracer of the sub-dominant dark matter clump in the merging cluster,
i.e. the bullets.

For the redshifts $z=0.0,0.25,
0.5$ and $1.0$ we find $10041, 10346, 10554$ and $10382$ host halos
and $157853, 177331, 195072, 225188$ sub-halos, respectively. These
two sets (host halos and sub-halos) constitute the basis for our
analysis. We find now for each host halo we its most massive sub-halo. Each pair
host halo/sub-halo is considered as a potential Bullet system and is
kept for the analysis described in the next Section. 

\section{Bullet Geometry and Measurement Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

The Bullet groups is composed by two halos. the host halo and the sub
halo. This configuration is described by the position and velocity of
the sub-halo in a frame of reference where the main halo is at rest;
thus  $\vec{v{}}=\vec{v}_{sub}-\vec{v}_{halo}$ and 
$\vec{r}=\vec{r}_{sub}-\vec{r}_{halo}$, where the subscripts $host$
and $sub$ refer to the host and sub-halo in the frame of reference of
the simulation, respectively.

The angle between these two vectors characterized by, 
\begin{equation}
  \mu\equiv
  \cos(\theta)=\frac{\vec{v{}}\cdotp{}\vec{r}}{\left\|\vec{v}{}\right\|
    \left\|\vec{r}\right\|} 
 \end{equation} 
%
encodes the geometry of the collision, i.e. cases of $|\mu|\approx 1$
can be considered as head-on collisions while $|\mu|\approx 0$
describe a grazing trajectory.

The bullet-like encounter can be instantaneously described by
quantities the following quantities the circular velocity of the host
and the sub-halo, $V_{\rm c,host}$ and $V_{\rm c,  sub}$; the size of
the host halo $R_{\rm vir}$; the relative position and velocity of the
substructure, $\vec{v}$ and $\vec{r}$; and the angle between the
position and velocity $\mu$. 

As a first approximation there are two quantities that are available
from observations of these Bullet-like systems. The projected distance
between two dominant dark matter clumps and the ratio of the
galaxies luminosities associated to them. From the simulation point
of view this can be translated into the 2D projected values of
$||\vec{r}||$, its value relative to the virial radius $D_{\rm off}=
||\vec{r}||_{\rm 2D}/R_{\rm vir}$ and the ratio of the circular velocities
of the two clumps $V_{\rm c,sub}/V_{\rm c,host}$. In a higher degree
of detail, in order to gain better insight we use
the sub-structure velocity as a fraction of the host's circular
velocity, $||\vec{r}||/V_{\rm c, host}$, as a measure of the the strength
of the interaction.  Finally, we also measure the geometry of each
interaction through the values for $\mu$.


All the physical quantities described above can be used to describe
the three main stages in a bullet-like encounter. First, the sub-halo
crosses the virial radius of the host halo starting a head on
collision, $||\vec{r}||/R_{\rm vir}\approx 1$ and
$\mu\approx<0.0$. Second, as the sub-halo crosses for the first time
the center of the host halo $||\vec{r}||/R_{\rm vir} < 1.0$ and
$\mu>0.0$. Third, as the sub-halo reaches apogee and comes back to the
center of the halo $||\vec{r}||/R_{\rm vir} < 1.0$ and $\mu<0.0$. We use
this quantities in Section XXX to fully characterize the different
kind of interactions observed in the Bolshoi simulation. 



\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

\subsection{Displacements and Relative Circular Velocities}
\label{fig:displacement}

  group sample $V_{\rm circ,host}>700\kms$ and the dashed lines to the

  between the two dark matter clumps in the results reported by
  \citet{Gastaldello} for the group SL2S J08544-0121. Between $50\%$
  to $60\%$ of the groups show a displacement equal or larger than
  this observational benchmark.}

  right panel to groups. The circle with error bars corresponds to

  \citet{Gastaldello}. The data used to construct the histograms
  integrates the objects at all redshifts. }
\label{fig:mass_displacement}
\end{figure*}




The main result of this paper is summarized in Figure
\ref{fig:displacement}, it presents the integrated
probability distribution for the displacement between the center of
the host halo and its dominant sub-halo. The left panel shows
the displacement in physical units and the right panel as a fraction
of the virial radius of the host halo. 

Figure \ref{fig:displacement} shows the results for two different
populations; groups with $300\kms < V_{\rm c, host}<700\kms$ and
clusters with $V_{\rm c,host}>700\kms$. Additionally, this is
presented for all redshifts $z=0.0, 0.25, 0.5$ and $1.0$. 

The panel with the physical displacements also shows a vertical stripe
with the estimated displacement for the Bullet-group reported by
\cite{Gastaldello}. Considering this system as consistent withe the
groups sample we see that a fraction of $\sim 15\pm 2\%$ of the groups
should present a displacement equal or larger than the one estimated
for \bullg, this fraction is close to $45\pm2\% $. The panel with the
normalized displacements shows a  distribution that can be considered
close to universal in the sense that the two samples (groups and
clusters) at all redshifts present a similar trend.[...]

Figure \ref{fig:mass_displacement} shows 2D histograms in a plane
composed by the ratio of the two circular velocities $V_{\rm c,
  sub}/V_{\rm c, host}$ and the physical displacements. This is
revealing because these two quantities can be constrained by
observations. The displacement is a direct observable, while the ratio
of the circular velocities can be estimated from lensing studies or
approximated by the ratio of the total galaxy luminosity associated
with the galaxy peaks.

To construct this figure we co-add all the halos in the sample (left,
groups; right, clusters) at all redshifts. We stack the data because
we do not observe any strong time evolution, additionally this allows
us to increase the signal in each bin. Overplotted there is an circle
with error bars that represents the observational estimates for the
system \bullg using the fraction in velocity dispersion in
the line-of-sigth of the group SL2S SJ08544-0121
($\sigma_{host}=341^{+43}_{-109}$\kms and
$\sigma_{sub}=185^{+30}_{-62}$\kms) reported by
\citet{2013A&A...552A..80M} and the DM displacement inferred from the
data presented by \cite{Gastaldello}.


\subsection{Relative Velocities}
\label{sec:velocities}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figure_3.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Integrated probability distribution for the relative velocity of the
sub-halo with respect to its host. The left panel shows the results
in physical units while the right panel show the same values
normalized by the circular velocity of the host halo. The line coding
follows the same structure as Figure \ref{fig:displacement}}
\label{fig:velocities}
\end{figure*}

In Figure \ref{fig:velocities} we present the integrated probability
of the relative peculiar velocities of the sub-halos with respect to
the host halo. The left panel presents this velocity in physical units
while the left panel presents them as a fraction of the circular
velocity of the host halo.  


The panel with the normalized velocities shows that the distribution
of sub-halo velocities is close to universal. Regardless of the mass
of the host halo and the redshift the integrated distributions lie
very close to each other.  


The median of this distribution is located at $v/V_{\rm
  c,host}=1.1$. We also note the strong break at $v/V_{\rm
  c,host}=3.0$ that is present in the data from the group sample that
allows us to probe fractions on the order of $10^{-4}$.  This break is
located close the escape velocity of $v/V_{\rm c,host}$ for dark
matter halos following a NFW profile with a concentration value
$c\approx 6$ \citep{Hayashi2006}.  



\subsection{Collision Geometries}
\label{fig:geometry}

\begin{figure*}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figure_4.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{2D histograms in the plane $\mu$-$D_{\rm off}$. The left
  panel corresponds to clusters and the right panel to groups. The data
  used to construct this histogram includes the halos at all redshifts.}
\label{fig:geometry}
\end{figure*}


Figure \ref{fig:geometry} presents the geometry of the bullet groups using the 
variables $\mu$ and $D_{\rm off}$. The first evident feature is that
most of the configurations have $|mu|>0.9$ ($\theta\leq 30^{\circ}$),
meaning that most of the collisions can be described as a head-on while
only a minority with $|mu|<0.9$ have more tangential trajectories. For
the pairs on radial trajectories there are three regions of interest
in this plane that describe different stages in the collision,
assuming that the sub-halo merges or falls below the detection
threshold after the first pass through the center of the host halo.


The first region has $\mu\approx-1$ and $D_{\rm off}>0.6$, which
locates the systems where a head-on collision has just started. The
sub-halo is close to the boundary of the host halo and is
infalling. The second region has $\mu\approx 1$ and $D_{\rm off}<0.6$;
at this stage the collision continues after the first crossing of the
host's center, the low number of halos with radial infalling velocities
and displacements $D_{\rm off}>0.6$ suggest that this the maximum
range of radii for the apogee.  The third region corresponds to
$\mu\approx-1$ and $D_{\rm off}<0.6$ which corresponds to the
secondary infall after apogee. 



\subsection{Displacement between Dark Matter and Baryons}
\label{sec:baryonic_displacements}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figure_5.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Integrated probability distribution for the estimated
  baryonic displacements in the group and cluster samples. The
  continuous line marked as $P_{2D}$ shows the statistics reported by
  \citet{ForeroRomero2010} for a cosmological simulation including DM
  and baryons. The vertical lines correspond to the mean value and
  uncertainty of the displacement measured for \bullg.}
\label{fig:baryonic_displacements}
\end{figure}

These different collision geometries will produce different results in
terms of the displacement between dark matter and baryons. Strictly
speaking, the results we have derived so far, apply to multi-modal groups and their
expected separation between the two dominant dark matter clumps but it
should not be interpreted that all have a corresponding DM-baryon
displacement. The systems where the halo is starting to fall into the
host ($\mu\approx-1$, $D_{\rm off}>0.6$) should not present a
detectable DM-baryon displacement. 


We clearly expect such displacement in the case where the
sub-structure has already passed through the center of the host
halo. In this section we attempt an estimation for the DM-baryon
displacement statistics. We work under the following
hypothesis. First, we consider that systems with $|\mu|<0.9$ have a
baryonic displacement, $d_{2D}^{\rm bar}$, equal to zero. Second, we
consider that all systems with infalling velocities $\mu<-0.9$ and
large displacements $D_{\rm off}>0.6$ also have baryonic displacements
equal to zero. Third, for all the other cases we estimate the
displacement between the baryons and the dominant DM peak by the
distances between the dominant peak and the center of mass of the main
halo, $d_{2D}^{\rm bar}=D_{\rm off} R_{\rm vir}$, where $X_{\rm off}$
is the offset computed for each host halo in the original catalog.

This simplified model does not take into account that there is a
fraction of halos with $\mu<-0.9$ and $D_{\rm off}<0.6$ for which the
collision has not started and should have $d_{2D}^{\rm bar}=0$. A detailed
modeling of this fraction requires the study of the complete merger
tree of the halo and sub-halo, a study beyond the scope of this
Letter. Instead we caution the reader that the derived fraction of
halos with a displacement $<d_{2D}^{\rm bar}$ can be considered as an
upper limit. 

The results for the integrated distributions for $>d_{2D}^{\rm bar}$
are shown in Figure \ref{fig:baryonic_displacements}. The dashed lines
represented the results for groups and the continuous lines correspond
to clusters. As a test of our approach we compare the cluster results
against the analytic fit provided by \cite{ForeroRomero2010}. This fit
reproduces the statistics for the DM-baryon separation found for
clusters more massive than $>10^{14}$\hMsun in a simulation
that included a description for gas with $8$ times the volume of the
Bolshoi Simulation. This fit is valid for separations larger than
$70$\hkpc, beyond that separation we find that it provides a good
description within a factor of $\sim 2$ of  




\section{Observational Implications}
\label{sec:observations}


\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this Letter we estimate fraction of galaxy groups
that can present observational features associated to a
bullet-like event. This is motivated by the recent observational
results of \citep{Gastaldello} where a system (\bullg) on the mass range
$1\times 10^{14}$\hMsun and velocity dispersion $650$\kms was reported
to feature a displacement between its baryonic (hot gas) and dark
matter components. 

Our estimate is based on large N-body dark matter only cosmological
simulation. We estimate the distribution of projected displacements
between the dominant DM clumps in two kinds of systems; groups with
circular velocities $300\kms<V_{\rm c}<700\kms$ and clusters with $V_{\rm
  c}>700$\kms. We report these results at four different redshifts
$z=0.0,0.25,0.5$ and $10$.

We find that a fraction of $50\%$-$60\%$ of the halos in the group
sample present displacement equal or larger than the observed displacement
for \bullg. For halos in the cluster sample this fraction increases to
$80\%$-$85\%$. 


We also describe the collision geometry by the angle between
the position and velocity vectors of the sub-halo with respect to the
host. This allows us to separate three different instances: the
sub-halo crossing the host virial radius, the sub-halo going
through the host's center and the secondary infall after reaching
apogee.  

From this analysis we derive an estimate for the displacement between
the DM and the baryonic component. In the group sample
$0.1\%$-$1.0\%$ of the halos show a displacement equal or larger than 
the  measurements of \bullg by \citep{Gastaldello}. In the cluster
sample this fraction rises to $4\%$-$10\%$.


The results we present here can be used as a potential test of
$\Lambda$CDM. [...]
